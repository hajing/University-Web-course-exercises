    You see, or see me

    There I was

    No Lamentations don't like

    You read, or don't read my

    Affection there

    Don't come not to

    You love, or doesn't love me

    Love is there

    When it does not increase don't reduce

    You with, or is not with me

    My hand is in your hands

    Don't give up

    To my arms

    or

    Let me live into your heart

    Love silently

    Silence glad
